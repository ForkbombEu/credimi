# Platform Architecture

## Overview

DIDimo's platform architecture is designed with a focus on security, scalability, and interoperability. Our decentralized identity infrastructure uses cutting-edge technologies to provide robust identity management solutions while maintaining user privacy and data sovereignty.

## Core Components

### Identity Layer

The foundation of our platform is built on a distributed ledger technology that ensures:

- Immutable identity records
- Cryptographically secured identity assertions
- Decentralized identity verification
- Persistent yet revocable credential management

### Credential Service

Our credential service handles the issuance, verification, and revocation of digital credentials:

- Standards-based credential formats (W3C Verifiable Credentials)
- Selective disclosure capabilities
- Zero-knowledge proof integration
- Credential status verification

### Consent Management System

Users maintain control of their identity through our comprehensive consent framework:

- Granular permission settings
- Auditable consent records
- Time-bound access grants
- One-click revocation

## Technical Stack

### Backend Infrastructure

- **Microservices Architecture**: Modular services that scale independently
- **Containerization**: Docker-based deployment for consistent environments
- **Kubernetes Orchestration**: Automated scaling and high availability
- **Serverless Functions**: For event-driven operations with minimal overhead

### Security Framework

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All data in transit and at rest
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Configurable security levels
- **Hardware Security Module Integration**: For key management
- **Threat Detection Systems**: Real-time monitoring and response

### Data Storage

- **Distributed Data Storage**: No single point of failure
- **IPFS Integration**: For decentralized content addressing
- **Encrypted Data Vaults**: User-controlled secure storage
- **Key-Value Stores**: For high-performance metadata access
